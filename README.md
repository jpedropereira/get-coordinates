# GET COORDINATES

Get Coordinates is a simple app that helps you download the corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates to a list of addresses using Excel as a GUI. 

## Instructions
In order to use Get Coordinates you need to get a Bing Maps API key and assign it to an environment variable named BING_API_KEY. You can get your Bing API key [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/create-a-bing-maps-key).

All you then need to do is to add the addresses for which you want to obtain the coordinates into column **C** of *address.xlsx* file. Optionally, you can add a code and a name corresponding to each address in columns **A** and **B**. Finally, just run *main.py* and latitude and longitude coordinates corresponding to the addresses will be populated in columns **D** and **E**.
